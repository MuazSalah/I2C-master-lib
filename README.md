### 1. What is this library? 
This library is an I2C master library which uses the TWI peripheral inside the
AVR microcontroller to establish connections using the I2C protocol

It is as simple as:
	I2C Master Writing:
		I2C_Writer(Target_Slave_Address,Slave_Rx_Buffer_Index,Data);
	I2C Master Reading:
		TEMP = I2C_Reader(Target_Slave_Address,Slave_Tx_Buffer_Index);

Checkout the included main file, connect both microcontrollers PORTB to some LEDs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Contents of this library
	
The library contains the following files:

* main.c
* I2C_master.c
* I2C_master.h

##### main.c
This is a piece of example code which uses this library to read out
and HMC5338L digital compass sensor.
		
##### I2C_master.c
This file contains all the function declarations to setup and work with the
TWI hardware peripheral inside the AVR.

*Make sure you add this source file to your Makefile!*
		
##### I2C_master.h 
This file contains the function prototypes and the definition of the 
Read / Write bit (0 = read, 1 = write)
		
*This file has to be included in your source file*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
### 3. Supported devices
Though I have only tested this library on an ATmega328P it should be running
on all major ATmega AVRs like:
		
* ATmega644
* ATmega32
* ATmega16
* ATmega328/P
* ATmega168/P
* ATmega88/P
* ATmega44/P
* ATmega8
	
If your device is not supported you can probably adapt this library easily to your
needs by having a look at the your device's datasheet and changing the register names
appropriately

The ATtiny range of microcontrolles is not supported as they only provide a USI 
peripheral which is completely different from the TWI peripheral used on the
other controllers

##### void I2C_init(void)
This function needs to be called only once to set up the correct SCL frequency 
for the bus
		
##### uint8_t I2C_start(uint8_t address)
This function needs to be called any time a connection to a new slave device should
be established. The function returns 1 if an error has occured, otherwise it returns
0.
		
The syntax to start a operation write to a device is either:
`I2C_start(SLAVE_ADDRESS+I2C_WRITE);`
or
`I2C_start(SLAVE_WRITE_ADDRESS);`
		
The syntax to start a read operation from a device is either:
`I2C_start(SLAVE_ADDRESS+I2C_READ);`
or
`I2C_start(SLAVE_READ_ADDRESS);`
		
##### uint8_t I2C_write(uint8_t data)
This function is used to write data to the currently active device. 
The only parameter this funcion takes is the 8 bit unsigned integer to be sent.
The function returns 1 if an error has occured, otherwise it returns
0.
		
##### uint8_t I2C_read_ack(void)
This function is used to read one byte from a device and request another byte of data 
after the transmission is complete by sending the acknowledge bit.
This function returns the received byte.
		
##### uint8_t I2C_read_nack(void)
This function is used to read one byte from a device an then not requesting another 
byte and therefore stoping the current transmission.
This function returns the received byte.




##### void I2C_Writer(uint8_t Address, uint8_t Location, uint8_t Data)
This function utilises the above functions to make a single stop function to write to an I2C device,
tested successfuly in data transfer between two ATmega328P

	Input Parameters:
		<unsigned 8-bit integer>		<Address>			<Address of the slave I2C member>
		<unsigned 8-bit integer>		<Location>				<Location in the slave receiver buffer>
		<unsigned 8-bit integer>		<Data>					<Data to be transmitted>
		
	Outputs:
		N/A

##### uint8_t I2C_Reader(uint8_t Address, uint8_t Location)
This function also utilises the above functions to make a single stop function to read from an I2C slave device,
tested successfuly in data transfer between two ATmega328P
	Input Parameters:
		<unsigned 8-bit integer>		<Address>		<Address of the slave I2C member>
		<unsigned 8-bit integer>		<Location>		<Location in the slave transmitting buffer>
		
	Outputs:
		<unsigned 8-bit integer>		<temp>			<Data the have been read from slave>


##### void I2C_stop(void)
This function disables the TWI peripheral completely
and therefore disconnects the device from the bus
